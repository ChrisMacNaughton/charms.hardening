    """Hardening decorator.

    This is the main entry point for running the hardening stack. In order to
    run modules of the stack you must add this decorator to charm hook(s) and
    ensure that your charm config.yaml contains the 'harden' option set to
    one or more of the supported modules. Setting these will cause the
    corresponding hardening code to be run when the hook fires.

    This decorator can and should be applied to more than one hook or function
    such that hardening modules are called multiple times. This is because
    subsequent calls will perform auditing checks that will report any changes
    to resources hardened by the first run (and possibly perform compliance
    actions as a result of any detected infractions).

    :param overrides: Optional list of stack modules used to override those
                      provided with 'harden' config.
    :returns: Returns value returned by decorated function once executed.
